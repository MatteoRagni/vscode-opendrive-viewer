# ODRViewer.io in VSCode

The extension allow to visualize OpenDRIVE file in Visual Studio Code. Unshamelessy stolen from the awesome
[odrviewer.io](https://odrviewer.io) and modified just enough to be used in the editor

To launch the visualization, simply click on the preview button while in an editor for a file ending with `".xodr"`
or launch the command `OpenDRIVE: Show the current OpenDRIVE in ODRViewer`

The position of the camera does not change between updates of the OpenDRIVE.

The extensions defines the language `opendrive` and provides a full set of snippets relative to the
OpenDRIVE definition.
