# ODRViewer.io in VSCode

The extension allow to visualize OpenDRIVE file in Visual Studio Code. Unshamelessy stolen from the awesome
[odrviewer.io](https://odrviewer.io) and modified just enough to be used in the editor

To launch the visualization, simply click on the preview button while in an editor for a file ending with `".xodr"`
or launch the command `OpenDRIVE: Show the current OpenDRIVE in ODRViewer`
